# Migration 028 Fix Applied ✅

## Issue Found
**Error:** `ERROR: 42P01: relation "admin_action_log" does not exist`

## Root Cause
The table name mismatch between migrations:
- Migration 027 creates: `admin_action_logs` (plural)
- Migration 028 was referencing: `admin_action_log` (singular)

Additionally, the column name for the user was incorrect:
- Correct column name: `admin_user_id`
- Wrong column name used: `user_id`

## Fix Applied

### Files Updated:

#### 1. `supabase/migrations/028_admin_rbac_functions.sql`
**Changed lines 190-195:**
```sql
-- BEFORE (Wrong)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_admin_action_log_org_date 
ON admin_action_log(organization_id, created_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_admin_action_log_user 
ON admin_action_log(user_id, created_at DESC);

-- AFTER (Correct)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_admin_action_logs_org_date 
ON admin_action_logs(organization_id, created_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_admin_action_logs_user 
ON admin_action_logs(admin_user_id, created_at DESC);
```

#### 2. `ADMIN_FEATURES_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
**Updated two references:**
- Changed `admin_action_log` → `admin_action_logs`
- Changed `user_id` → `admin_user_id`
- Changed `old_state` → `previous_state`

## How to Run the Migration Now

```bash
# The migration should now work without errors
psql -h YOUR_HOST -U postgres -d YOUR_DB -f supabase/migrations/028_admin_rbac_functions.sql
```

Or with Supabase CLI:
```bash
supabase migration up
```

## Verification
After running the migration, verify the indexes were created:

```sql
-- Check if indexes exist
SELECT indexname, tablename 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'admin_action_logs';
```

Expected output:
```
indexname                           | tablename
------------------------------------+------------------
idx_admin_action_logs_org_date     | admin_action_logs
idx_admin_action_logs_user         | admin_action_logs
```

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Migration is now ready to run

## Next Steps
1. Run the fixed migration
2. Verify with the SQL query above
3. Proceed with migration 029 (seed data)
4. Continue with implementation plan
