# Dashboard Selector Fix - Salesman Dashboard Integration

## Issue
Admin users with the dashboard role selector were loading the **old widget-based salesman dashboard template** instead of the new **PremiumSalesmanDashboard** component when selecting "SALESMAN" role from the dropdown.

## Root Cause
The `PremiumEnhancedDashboard` component had a role selector that allowed admins to view different role dashboards, but it only loaded different widget templates - it did NOT conditionally render the specialized `PremiumSalesmanDashboard` component when the salesman role was selected.

## Solution

### 1. Updated `PremiumEnhancedDashboard.tsx`

**Added Import:**
```typescript
import PremiumSalesmanDashboard from '@/components/dashboard/PremiumSalesmanDashboard'
```

**Added Conditional Rendering Logic:**
```typescript
// If viewing as SALESMAN role, render the PremiumSalesmanDashboard instead
if (viewRole === UserRole.SALESMAN) {
  return (
    <PremiumSalesmanDashboard
      userId={_userId}
      userRole={viewRole}
      organizationId={dashboard.organizationId || ''}
      darkMode={darkMode}
    />
  )
}
```

**Location:** Added right before the main return statement (after all hooks, line ~744)

This ensures:
- ✅ All React hooks are called in the correct order
- ✅ When admin selects "SALESMAN" from dropdown → renders PremiumSalesmanDashboard
- ✅ When admin selects any other role → renders widget-based dashboard with appropriate templates
- ✅ darkMode state is passed through correctly
- ✅ organizationId context is maintained

### 2. Fixed Deprecated Supabase Import

**File:** `src/lib/services/salesman-kpi-engine.ts`

**Old (Deprecated):**
```typescript
import { createClientComponentClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'
// ...
private supabase = createClientComponentClient()
```

**New (Unified):**
```typescript
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase'
// ...
private supabase = supabase
```

**Why:** The `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` package is deprecated and was causing module not found errors. Using the unified supabase singleton from `@/lib/supabase` is the correct pattern used throughout the codebase.

## Testing Verification

### Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ Compiled successfully
# ✓ Generating static pages (137/137)
```

### How to Test

1. **Login as Admin user**
2. **Navigate to /dashboard**
3. **Locate the role selector dropdown** (top header area)
4. **Select "SALESMAN" from dropdown**
5. **Verify:** Should now see the **Premium Salesman Dashboard** with:
   - 📊 Funnel Health Score (weighted velocity + volume)
   - 🎯 Win Rate percentage
   - 📈 Revenue Growth (period-over-period)
   - 💰 Average Deal Size
   - 🎪 Performance vs Target (with animated progress bar)
   - 🔍 Funnel Stage Breakdown (with velocity indicators)
   - ⏰ Timeframe selector (Weekly/Monthly/Annually)
   - 🔄 Refresh button

6. **Select another role** (e.g., "ADMIN", "SALES_MANAGER")
7. **Verify:** Should see the **widget-based customizable dashboard**

## User Flows Now Working

| User Type | Scenario | Expected Dashboard |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Actual Salesman** | Logs in, visits /dashboard | PremiumSalesmanDashboard (routed at page level) |
| **Admin viewing as Salesman** | Selects "SALESMAN" from dropdown | PremiumSalesmanDashboard (conditional render) |
| **Admin viewing as Manager** | Selects "SALES_MANAGER" from dropdown | Widget-based dashboard (manager template) |
| **Admin viewing as Admin** | Default or selects "ADMIN" | Widget-based dashboard (admin template) |
| **Manager** | Logs in, visits /dashboard | Widget-based dashboard (manager template) |

## Architecture Notes

### Dashboard Routing Strategy
```
/dashboard (page.tsx)
├─ User Role = SALESMAN → PremiumSalesmanDashboard
└─ User Role = Other → PremiumEnhancedDashboard
    ├─ viewRole selector (admin only)
    ├─ viewRole = SALESMAN → PremiumSalesmanDashboard (NEW FIX)
    └─ viewRole = Other → Widget-based with role templates
```

### Component Hierarchy
```
DashboardPage (SSR)
├─ PremiumSalesmanDashboard (for salesmen)
│  └─ Hardcoded 8 pharmaceutical KPIs
└─ PremiumEnhancedDashboard (for others)
   ├─ DashboardProvider context
   ├─ Role selector (admin only)
   └─ Conditional render:
      ├─ If viewRole = SALESMAN → PremiumSalesmanDashboard
      └─ Else → Widget grid (customizable)
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/dashboard/PremiumEnhancedDashboard.tsx**
   - Added PremiumSalesmanDashboard import
   - Added conditional rendering based on `viewRole === UserRole.SALESMAN`
   - Preserved all hooks ordering (no hook errors)

2. **src/lib/services/salesman-kpi-engine.ts**
   - Replaced deprecated `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` import
   - Now uses unified `@/lib/supabase` singleton
