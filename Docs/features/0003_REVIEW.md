   - Should be removed or replaced with proper logging framework for production

2. **TypeScript `any` Types**
   - Several instances of `any` type usage in API functions and data handling
   - Should be replaced with proper TypeScript interfaces for better type safety

3. **Incomplete Function Implementation**
   - `handleWidgetMove` function in `RoleBasedDashboard.tsx` appears to have incomplete implementation
   - Missing function body for widget movement handling

### Data Alignment Issues: **NONE FOUND**
