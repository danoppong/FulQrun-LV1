## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
2. **Validate all inputs**: Use the provided validation schemas
3. **Sanitize user content**: Use DOMPurify for HTML content
4. **Follow principle of least privilege**: Grant minimum required permissions
5. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update packages for security patches
6. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
7. **Implement proper error handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors

### For Administrators
1. **Regular security audits**: Conduct monthly security reviews
2. **Monitor access logs**: Watch for suspicious activity
3. **Update regularly**: Keep the application and dependencies updated
4. **Backup security**: Ensure backups are encrypted and secure
5. **Access control**: Regularly review user permissions
6. **Incident response**: Have a plan for security incidents
