# Context 001 — Session Summary

Date: 2025-10-11
Repository: FulQrun-LV1 (branch: NewBranch)

## Overview

This session focused on securing protected routes, improving code quality, and enhancing the Opportunities list with new columns and quick filters. We implemented Owner and Region filters, added column headings (including PEAK Stage and MEDDPICC), and ensured the edited file is lint-clean.

## Timeline and Key Activities

- Secured routes and APIs
  - Middleware route guards for protected pages (e.g., dashboard, contact)
  - SSR redirects for unauthenticated access
  - API authentication helpers and basic per-IP rate limiting
  - Standardized Cache-Control headers across endpoints
- Type and lint hardening
  - Replaced remaining explicit `any` types with `unknown`/`Record<string, unknown>` in admin modules
  - Escaped JSX apostrophes where needed
  - Lint run confirmed 0 errors (warnings remain, non-blocking)
  - Type-check revealed broader gaps in workflow-related Supabase table typings (to address separately)
- Opportunities feature enhancement
  - Added Owner and Region quick filters alongside search and stage
  - Resolved Owner names via `user_profiles.full_name` using the unified `AuthService.getClient()`
  - Derived Region values from `region || territory_name || territory`
  - Applied client-side filtering for Owner/Region in addition to search/stage
  - Introduced table-like headings: Opportunity, Account, Owner, Region, PEAK Stage, MEDDPICC, Amount
  - Used `meddpiccScoringService` to compute and display MEDDPICC values
  - Verified the edited file is lint-clean

## Files Changed

- `src/components/opportunities/OpportunityList.tsx`
  - Owner/Region filters and options
  - Owner name resolution via `user_profiles`
  - Region derivation helper and filter application
  - Table-like headings and additional columns (Owner, Region, MEDDPICC)
  - Hook ordering and helper functions cleanup
  - Non-breaking, responsive layout preserved

## Notable Decisions

- Use unified `AuthService` for Supabase client access in client components
- Keep Owner/Region filtering client-side for responsiveness; consider server-side filtering if datasets grow
- Show MEDDPICC from cached/computed scores with fallback to stored value

## Known Follow-Ups

- Type-check stabilization: add minimal Supabase table typings for workflow entities (e.g., enterprise_workflows, workflow_executions, workflow_step_executions) to avoid `never` propagation
- Optional: Migrate Owner/Region filters to server-side for large datasets and pagination compatibility
- Optional: Improve Region canonicalization (e.g., join against territories table if available)

## How to Run

- Start dev server and view the Opportunities page:
  - Navigate to `/opportunities`
  - Use the Owner and Region filters in combination with search and stage

## Validation

- Lint and types for the edited file: no errors reported
- Dev server starts without startup errors

## Snapshot of Current State

- Security posture improved for protected routes and APIs
- Lint errors resolved in targeted admin modules
- Opportunities list enhanced with quick filters and clearer columns
- Broader type definitions for workflow modules still pending

## Session Continuation — 2025-10-13

This section captures the latest chat-driven work: wiring the PEAK Workflow to `/peak`, stabilizing tests around the PEAK transition API, and fixing a runtime bug in StageDocuments. It also notes build/lint/test status and logs highlights for future reference.

### Overview

- Goal: Ensure `/peak` shows the PEAK workflow without extra clicks; strengthen API route tests; fix StageDocuments runtime error.
- Focus areas:
  - PEAK page should automatically display the workflow for the user’s most recent opportunity when no `opportunityId` is provided.
  - Jest testing for API route handlers should not pull in Next’s server runtime; ensure green test runs.
  - Fix “Cannot access 'loadStageRequirements' before initialization” error in `StageDocuments`.

### Actions Taken

1) Wire PEAK Workflow to `/peak`
- Updated `src/app/peak/page.tsx` to:
  - Auto-select the most recently updated opportunity for the current user’s organization if `opportunityId` is missing.
  - Use `AuthService.getClient()` and `AuthService.getCurrentUser()` to stay RLS-safe and multi-tenant aware.
  - Replace URL with `?opportunityId=...&opportunityName=...` so the state is shareable and the workflow renders immediately.
  - Keep the “View Opportunities” CTA, adding a hint that auto-selection is attempted.

2) Stabilize PEAK transition API route tests
- `src/app/api/peak/transition/route.ts`
  - Changed to type-only import of `NextRequest` and removed `NextResponse` at module scope.
  - Introduced a small `json()` helper that returns a standard Web `Response` object to avoid Next runtime in tests.
  - Kept behavior identical in production (`runtime = 'nodejs'`).
- `jest.setup.ts`
  - Added minimal, typed polyfills for `Headers` and `Response` for test environment.
  - Retained router mocks and `crypto.randomUUID` polyfill.
- `src/tests/peak-transition-api.test.ts`
  - Ensured mocks are registered before importing the route by dynamically importing in `beforeAll`.
  - Built a minimal NextRequest-like object to call the handler directly.

3) Fix StageDocuments runtime error
- `src/components/peak/StageDocuments.tsx`
  - Reordered hooks: defined `loadStageRequirements` with `useCallback` before referencing it inside `useEffect`.
  - Eliminated temporal dead zone (“Cannot access 'loadStageRequirements' before initialization”).

### Files Changed (latest session)

- `src/app/peak/page.tsx` — Auto-select most recent opportunity when none provided; show workflow immediately.
- `src/app/api/peak/transition/route.ts` — Avoid Next server import side-effects; use Web `Response` helper.
- `jest.setup.ts` — Add Headers/Response polyfills for Node/JSDOM tests.
- `src/tests/peak-transition-api.test.ts` — Import route after mocks; improved isolation and reliability.
- `src/components/peak/StageDocuments.tsx` — Reorder hook definitions to fix runtime ReferenceError.

### Verification and Quality Gates

- Tests: PASS — 230/230 after changes. The PEAK API test that previously failed (Request/Response issues) now passes.
- Lint: PASS — 0 errors (warnings remain elsewhere, non-blocking and unrelated to the above changes).
- Build: PASS — Next.js build OK; dev server verified. `/peak` compiles and renders.

### Logs and Diagnostics (highlights)

- Dev server initially on port 3000; later Next selected port 3001 when 3000 was in use.
- Console error fixed: “Cannot access 'loadStageRequirements' before initialization” from `StageDocuments`.
- Jest failure resolved for PEAK transition API: replaced `NextResponse.json` with a `Response` helper and added Web API polyfills.

### Try It

- Navigate to `/peak` while authenticated. If there’s no `opportunityId` query param, the page auto-selects your most recent opportunity and renders the PEAK workflow.
- Confirm advancing stage calls `/api/peak/transition` and updates stage UI.

### Notes / Follow-ups

- Optional: Convert `/peak` auto-selection to server-side redirect for fully server-first behavior.
- Optional: Add more integration tests for PEAK API (rate-limit path, invalid transitions) if desired.
- Branding uploads remain paused until Storage RLS policies are created by the bucket owner; status endpoint and UI guidance are already in place.
