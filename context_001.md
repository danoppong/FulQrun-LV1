# Context 001 â€” Session Summary

Date: 2025-10-11
Repository: FulQrun-LV1 (branch: NewBranch)

## Overview

This session focused on securing protected routes, improving code quality, and enhancing the Opportunities list with new columns and quick filters. We implemented Owner and Region filters, added column headings (including PEAK Stage and MEDDPICC), and ensured the edited file is lint-clean.

## Timeline and Key Activities

- Secured routes and APIs
  - Middleware route guards for protected pages (e.g., dashboard, contact)
  - SSR redirects for unauthenticated access
  - API authentication helpers and basic per-IP rate limiting
  - Standardized Cache-Control headers across endpoints
- Type and lint hardening
  - Replaced remaining explicit `any` types with `unknown`/`Record<string, unknown>` in admin modules
  - Escaped JSX apostrophes where needed
  - Lint run confirmed 0 errors (warnings remain, non-blocking)
  - Type-check revealed broader gaps in workflow-related Supabase table typings (to address separately)
- Opportunities feature enhancement
  - Added Owner and Region quick filters alongside search and stage
  - Resolved Owner names via `user_profiles.full_name` using the unified `AuthService.getClient()`
  - Derived Region values from `region || territory_name || territory`
  - Applied client-side filtering for Owner/Region in addition to search/stage
  - Introduced table-like headings: Opportunity, Account, Owner, Region, PEAK Stage, MEDDPICC, Amount
  - Used `meddpiccScoringService` to compute and display MEDDPICC values
  - Verified the edited file is lint-clean

## Files Changed

- `src/components/opportunities/OpportunityList.tsx`
  - Owner/Region filters and options
  - Owner name resolution via `user_profiles`
  - Region derivation helper and filter application
  - Table-like headings and additional columns (Owner, Region, MEDDPICC)
  - Hook ordering and helper functions cleanup
  - Non-breaking, responsive layout preserved

## Notable Decisions

- Use unified `AuthService` for Supabase client access in client components
- Keep Owner/Region filtering client-side for responsiveness; consider server-side filtering if datasets grow
- Show MEDDPICC from cached/computed scores with fallback to stored value

## Known Follow-Ups

- Type-check stabilization: add minimal Supabase table typings for workflow entities (e.g., enterprise_workflows, workflow_executions, workflow_step_executions) to avoid `never` propagation
- Optional: Migrate Owner/Region filters to server-side for large datasets and pagination compatibility
- Optional: Improve Region canonicalization (e.g., join against territories table if available)

## How to Run

- Start dev server and view the Opportunities page:
  - Navigate to `/opportunities`
  - Use the Owner and Region filters in combination with search and stage

## Validation

- Lint and types for the edited file: no errors reported
- Dev server starts without startup errors

## Snapshot of Current State

- Security posture improved for protected routes and APIs
- Lint errors resolved in targeted admin modules
- Opportunities list enhanced with quick filters and clearer columns
- Broader type definitions for workflow modules still pending
