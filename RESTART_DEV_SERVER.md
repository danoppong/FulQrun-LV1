# Restart Development Server

## The Fix is Ready! 

I've fixed the metric-templates API, but you need to restart your development server to pick up the changes.

## Steps to Restart

### 1. Stop the Current Server
In the terminal where `npm run dev` is running:
- Press `Ctrl + C` (or `Cmd + C` on Mac)
- Wait for the server to stop

### 2. Start the Server Again
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Wait for Compilation
You should see:
```
‚úì Ready in [time]
‚óã Local: http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Hard Refresh Your Browser
- **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

### 5. Try Creating a Metric Template Again

**Navigate to:**
```
http://localhost:3000/sales-performance
```

**Then:**
1. Click "Manage Templates" button
2. Click "Create Template"  
3. Fill in the form:
   - Name: "Test Metric"
   - Description: "Testing metric creation"
   - Category: Select any (e.g., "Revenue")
   - Metric Type: Select any (e.g., "Currency")
   - Unit: "USD"
   - Default Target: 100000
4. Click "Create Template"

### 6. Check the Results

**If it works:** ‚úÖ
- You'll see "Template created successfully" or similar
- The modal will close
- The new template will appear in the list

**If it still fails:** ‚ùå
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- Look for the error message
- Check the Terminal where dev server is running
- Copy the error details and share them with me

## What Was Fixed

1. **metric-templates GET API** - Removed foreign key ambiguity
2. **metric-templates POST API** - Added better error logging
3. **enhanced-metrics GET API** - Already fixed earlier

## Expected Server Output

When you restart, you should see in the terminal:
```
- info Linting and checking validity of types
- info Creating an optimized production build
- info Compiled successfully
‚úì Ready in [time]
```

No errors should appear during compilation.

## Troubleshooting

### If you see TypeScript errors:
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### If you see "Port 3000 already in use":
```bash
# Find and kill the process
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
# Then restart
npm run dev
```

### If browser still shows old error:
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Close all tabs with localhost:3000
3. Reopen in new tab

**Ready to go!** Just restart the server and try again. üöÄ
