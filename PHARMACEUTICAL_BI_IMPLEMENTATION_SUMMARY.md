- **Widget Rendering**: Added pharmaceutical widget rendering logic to existing widget system
- **Import Management**: Added all necessary imports for pharmaceutical components
- **Type Safety**: Ensured type safety for all pharmaceutical widget data

### 6. Configuration System
- **Role-Based Configurations**: Created comprehensive dashboard configurations for each user role
- **Widget Layouts**: Defined optimal widget layouts for different user roles
- **Default Widgets**: Provided default pharmaceutical widgets for each role
- **Merging Logic**: Implemented logic to merge pharmaceutical widgets with existing dashboard widgets

### 7. Role-Based Access Control
- **Salesman**: Access to individual pharmaceutical KPIs and product performance
- **Sales Manager**: Access to team-level pharmaceutical metrics and territory performance
- **Regional Sales Director**: Access to regional pharmaceutical data and comprehensive metrics
- **Global Sales Lead**: Access to global pharmaceutical data and all metrics
- **Business Unit Head**: Access to business unit pharmaceutical data and metrics
